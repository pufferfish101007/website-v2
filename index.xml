Actually, an addon isn&amp;rsquo;t much more than a combination of at least one of these: persistent scripts, userscripts and userstyles. If any of these are related, then we make them part of the same addon, under a single name. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Scratch 3 Developer Tools&amp;rdquo; addon has a userscript in charge of adding a find box to the editor, and a userstyle that adds CSS to that box.</description></item><item><title>addon.self</title><link>/docs/reference/addon-api/addon.self/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/reference/addon-api/addon.self/</guid><description>Available in userscripts ✔️ Available in persistent scripts ✔️ Required manifest permissions None Description Allows addons to get information about themselves or the browser.
Examples Using addon.self.dir With addon.self.dir, we can get the URL to an image inside the addon&amp;rsquo;s directory.

If you know anything about traps, please contribute!
addon.tab.traps is a public API for userscripts that can be used to obtain objects that are not otherwise available. The actual traps are coded at prototype-handler.
They share some APIs with &amp;ldquo;Once&amp;rdquo; traps, but is very different and is documented at Fake redux state separately.
Examples editor-stepping addon shows how to manipulate Thread object trapped.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>/docs/getting-started/quick-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/getting-started/quick-start/</guid><description>Installing Let&amp;rsquo;s get started by installing Scratch Addons.

Keep in mind Redux only applies on new page (ones with new navigation bar, including editor) Some extensions conflict with ScratchAddons' Redux feature. Do not use this when unnecessary.

For example, to get message count: addon.tab.redux.state.messageCount.messageCount

What is Scratch Addons? Scratch Addons is an &amp;ldquo;all-in-one&amp;rdquo; browser extension for the Scratch website and project editor. It provides features and themes (called addons internally), both for the Scratch website and the project editor. Scratch Addons' mission is to combine all existing Scratch extensions, userscripts and userstyles, developed by several members of the Scratch community, into a single easy-to-access place, while still letting users choose which ones to enable.</description></item><item><title>Chrome Web Store Privacy Information</title><link>/docs/privacy/chrome-web-store-privacy-information/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/privacy/chrome-web-store-privacy-information/</guid><description>This is how we fill the &amp;ldquo;privacy practices&amp;rdquo; form on the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.

Adding messages Under addons-l10n/en/, make a file named ADDONID.json, where ADDONID is the addon&amp;rsquo;s ID (the folder name). Write your messages that you want to translate there:
